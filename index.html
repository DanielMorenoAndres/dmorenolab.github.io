        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>During cell division in eukaryotes, the cell nuclei suffer tremendous functional and structural reorganization. In animal and human cells, the nuclear envelope breaks down at the beginning of mitosis and the chromatin condenses to individualized chromosomes. Afterwards, the prototypical X-shaped chromosomes are captured, and their sister chromatids are segregated by the spindle apparatus. Then, the chromosomes decondense in an energy-dependent process, allowing the re-assembly of a functional nucleus.

Mitosis is undoubtedly a complex and fascinating process that has been studied for centuries, but still continues to amaze us. We are still profoundly ignorant about its true molecular magnitude and its influence on subsequent phases of the cell cycle and the life of the organism. Studying the molecular details of its spectacular dynamics is essential for the basic knowledge of the living matter, but also medically relevant since it is emerging as a therapeutic target in diverse diseases, including cancer and ageing.</p> <!-- Add your content here -->
