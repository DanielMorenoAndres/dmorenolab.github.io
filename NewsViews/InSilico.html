    <h4>In silico synthesis of dynamic cell populations</h4> 
    
<ul class="custom-bullets">
<li>Live-cell imaging can accurately identify the nature of the cell cycle and mitotic defects. Therefore, live-cell microscopy experiments have become state-of-the-art in these research fields of the life sciences. To cope with the massive amount of data acquired with advanced high-throughput microscopy imaging technics, automatic segmentation, tracking and classification are imperative. Computer vision approaches, like machine learning algorithms and deep learning networks, have transformed the field and provide excellent automated results when sufficient manually annotated training data are available. However, to generate high quality annotated data sets is time-consuming and needs expert biologists. Additionally, the performance of a determined trained data set just to decrease considerably when it is applied to images acquired in different conditions, settings, and platforms than those used to acquire the data used for training. Data synthesis has been proposed to overcome those limitations and complement manually annotated training sets. Additionally, providing algorithm benchmarking and image restoration possibilities.</li>
