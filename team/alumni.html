<li><strong>June-hi koh</strong>, carried out her Bachelor Thesis characterizing Structural and functional roles of the MPN driver mutations CALRdel52 and JAK2V617F in the mitotic machinery of human TF-1 cells, a human hematopoietic tissue culture cell model. Currently she is Master student in Biological Sciences at the RWTH Aachen University.</li> 
<li><strong>Hatem Youssef</strong>, performed the reseach for his Master Thesis characterizing the protein expression of key mitotic regulators such as PLK1, MPS1, MAD2 or AurKB in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from healthy donors and patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.</li> 
<li><strong>Kristin Holl</strong>, as a PhD student and until her successful defense in August 2024, led our research aimed at studying <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-53240-8?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=oa_20240202&utm_content=10.1038/s41598-024-53240-8">how Calreticulin and JAK2V617F driver mutations induce distinct mitotic defects in myeloproliferative neoplasms</a>. Currently she is Validation Study Manager at MLM Medical Labs GmbH.</li>  
<li><strong>Felix Bärmann</strong>, carried out his Bachelor Thesis characterizing the mitosis in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from myeloproliferative neoplasms under treatment with Interferon-Alpha, one of the treatments often used for myeloproliferative neoplasms.</li>  
<li><strong>Amelie Thoma</strong>, carried out his Bachelor Thesis characterizing the mitosis in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from myeloproliferative neoplasms under treatment with ruxolitinib, one of the main treatments used in myeloproliferative neoplasms.</li>  
<li><strong>Sarah Schmitz</strong>, carried out his Bachelor Thesis characterizing influence of ruxolitinib, one of the main treatments used in myeloproliferative neoplasms, on mitotic progression in myeloproliferative neoplasms in hematopoietic tissue culture cell models expressing Calreticulin and JAK2V617F driver mutations.</li>  
<li><strong>Anja Scheufen</strong>, as lab technician, she was in charge of the lab maintenance and organization. She leaded her own project, and contributed to all the projects ongoing in the lab by performing wide variety of experiment types like RNA interference and drug treatments for confocal time-lapse microscopy with live cells at low and high resolution and Westenr Blot. Currently she is lab scientist at A&M Stabtest GmbH.</li>  
<li><strong>Nathalie Brock</strong>, carried out her Bachelor Thesis characterizing how Calreticulin and JAK2V617F driver mutations induce mitotic defects in TF-1 cells, a human hematopoietic tissue culture cell model. Later, as technical assistant, she performed lab maintenance work and helped in experiments to study mitotic progression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in myeloproliferative neoplasms.</li>  
<li><strong>Susanne Krapp</strong>, as technical assistant, performed lab maintenance work and experiments with human and murine myeloblastic cells to study mitotic progression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in myeloproliferative neoplasms.</li>  
<li><strong>Chantal Strobel</strong> as technical assistant, performed maintenance work on cell cultures, as well as RNA interference and drug treatments in experiments of confocal time-lapse microscopy with live cells at low and high resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Jadirah Sarmad</strong> carried out her Master Thesis, the very interesting results from her experiments of confocal time-lapse microscopy with live cells at high resolution, which will serve as a basis for our future research. Currently, PhD she is student at the The Institute of Molecular and Cellular Anatomy (Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University)</li>
